            As clich√© as it sounds, Atlet was built with simplicity in mind. Sometimes, it might
            be slightly overwhelming to do even something simple, using modern tools and frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now don't get me wrong, framworks such as Svelte, Vue, React, Angular, Solid and bunch more,
            they are doing an incredible job to provide developers with reliable tools, capable of 
            building huge, reliable and complex websites <b>and you should primarily use those </b>
            if you're building something serious.
          </p>

          <p>
            But in case you don't, or you're fully aware of what you're doing and you just want to quickly 
            write or prototype something, this might be the tool for you :)
